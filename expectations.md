Expectations From The Team

They should be approachable

They should be knowledgable

They should be somewhat prompt with communication

They should push me based on what I know, but apply gentle pressure

They should not just be focused on the coding but also develop people person skills as well


Expectations From Individuals
I should not aim to to do the bare minimum but rather, do as much as I can, especially if I think I can do more

If I get stuck, I should try find other resources instead of immediately asking for a solution

I should be communicating issues that I have earlier rather than later

I should not feel like I have any questions that are "too stupid to ask"

I should be looking for success in myself, rather than comparing to others
